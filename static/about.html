        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Ever since I had to do the egg drop test in middle school, I've always wondered, "Do we really need to drop a bunch of 
            eggs off the roof of a building to teach kids physics? In <i>this</i> economy?" With this web-based 3D egg drop simulator, 
            parents and educators can effortlessly prepare for physics lessons, sparing themselves both these questions and a carton of eggs.
        </p>

        <p>You can control the parameters of your own egg drop test on the Experimental Conditions page by selecting
            buttons and see the 3D simulation and calculated results on the Activity page. This egg drop simulator is based off of <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Egg-Drop/Egg-Drop-Interactive">
            this 2D egg drop simulator</a>.
